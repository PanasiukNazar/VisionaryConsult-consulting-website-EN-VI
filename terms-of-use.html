                        never charge you for the app or its services without
                        clearly explaining what you are paying for.

                        The Redvid app stores and processes the personal data
                        you provide to us to provide our service. It is your
                        responsibility to keep your phone and app access secure.

                    <p>
                        We recommend not jailbreaking or rooting your phone,
                        which is the process of removing software restrictions
                        and limitations imposed by your device's official
                        operating system. It could make your phone vulnerable to
                        malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
                        phone's security functions, and may result in the Redvid

                        You should be aware that there are certain things for
                        which elmoiv will not take responsibility. Some features
                        of the app will require the app to have an active
                        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or
                        provided by your mobile network provider, but elmoiv
                        cannot take responsibility if the app does not function
                        at full capacity if you do not have access to Wi-Fi and
                        no more data is available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are using the app outside an area with Wi-Fi,
                        remember that the terms of agreement with your mobile
                        network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
                        during the connection while accessing the app or other
                        third-party charges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In using the app, you accept responsibility for such
                        charges, including charges for data roaming if you use
                        the app outside your home territory (i.e., region or
                        country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not
                        the bill payer for the device on which you are using the
                        app, be aware that we assume you have obtained
                        permission from the bill payer to use the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, elmoiv cannot always take responsibility for
                        how you use the app, i.e., you must ensure that your
                        device remains charged - if the battery runs out and you
                        cannot turn it on to avail the service, elmoiv cannot
                        take responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regarding elmoiv's liability for your use of the app, it
                        is important to note that while we strive to ensure it
                        is always up-to-date and accurate, we rely on third
                        parties to provide us with information so that we can
                        make it available to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        elmoiv disclaims any liability for any loss, direct or
                        indirect, that you may suffer due to the complete
                        reliability of this app feature. At some point, we may
                        want to update the app. Currently, the app is available
                        on Android and iOS - the requirements for both systems
                        (and for any additional systems to which we decide to
                        extend the app's availability) may change, and you will
                        need to download updates if you wish to continue using
                        the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        elmoiv does not promise to always update the app to make
                        it relevant to you and/or compatible with the version of
                        Android and iOS installed on your device.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, you promise to always accept application
                        updates when offered. We may also want to stop providing
                        the app and may terminate use at any time without notice
                        to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon termination,
                        (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
                        terms will terminate; (b) you must stop using the app
                        and (if necessary) delete it from your device.
